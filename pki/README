    base/   - Contains most of the base source code
              needed to build this project.  Note that
              this directory does NOT contain
              implementation specific user-interface
              components required to build a working
              Certificate System.

    linux/  - Contains the scripts and user-interface
              components necessary to build a sample
              "generic" working Certificate System.
              The scripts in this directory leverage
              the base source code located in the
              "base/" directory, and are known to
              work on both 32-bit and 64-bit
              "Fedora 8" operating systems.  Users
              who wish to experiment with this project
              should focus on this directory first.
