   cmake/    - These files and this directory contain
               the top-level files necessary to integrate
               the CMake build system in pki.

    README   - This file.

    base/    - Contains most of the base source code
               needed to build this project.  Note that
               this directory does NOT contain
               implementation specific user-interface
               components required to build a working
               Certificate System.

    dogtag/  - Contains the scripts and user-interface
               components necessary to build a sample
               working "Dogtag Certificate System".
               The scripts in this directory leverage
               the base source code located in the
               "base/" directory, and are known to
               work on both 32-bit and 64-bit
               "Fedora" operating systems.  Users
               who wish to experiment with this project
               should focus on this directory first.

    patches/ - Contains "patches" needed for specific
               versions of this certificate system.

    scripts/ - Contains "scripts" used by this
               certificate system.  This directory
               contains numerous "compose" scripts
               useful for building RPMS/SRPMS of the
               various certificate system components.

    specs/   - Contains RPM spec files used for
               building RPMS/SRPMS of the various
               certificate system components.
