== Change nsPagedSizeLimit default value ==

The default value for `nsPagedSizeLimit` has been changed to `-1` to avoid
issues while cloning a CA or KRA that uses sequential serial numbers and
the CA or KRA is configured to access the database using an LDAP user.

Existing CA or KRA instances will need to be updated manually.
