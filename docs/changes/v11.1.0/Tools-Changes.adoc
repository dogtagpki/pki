= Tools Changes =

== pkispawn and pkidestroy Changes ==

Previously `pkispawn` and `pkidestroy` generated the logs on the console and also stored the logs into a file.
The tools have been modified to only generate the logs on the console by default.
To store the logs into a file as well, specify the file path using the `--log-file` option:

----
$ pkispawn ... --log-file <path>
----

== KRA CLI Changes ==

Previously `pki kra-key-retrieve` command supported both XML and JSON for input and output formats which could be specified using the optional arguments `--input-format` and `--output-format`. Now this command only supports JSON, so these options have been removed.

== New Database Access CLIs ==

The `pki-server <subsystem>-db-access` commands have been added to manage the access to PKI databases.

== pkidaemon Changes ==

The `pkidaemon status` command has been removed. Use `pki-server status` instead.
