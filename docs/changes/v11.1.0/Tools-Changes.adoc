== pkispawn and pkidestroy Changes ==

Previously `pkispawn` and `pkidestroy` generated the logs on the console and also stored the logs into a file.
The tools have been modified to only generate the logs on the console by default.
To store the logs into a file as well, specify the file path using the `--log-file` option:

----
$ pkispawn ... --log-file <path>
----
