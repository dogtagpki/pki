== Deprecate tpsclient ==

`tpsclient` has been deprecated. Use `pki tps-client` instead.

== New --skip-revocation-check option in pki ==

`pki` command has been modified to use JSSSocket. This enable by
default revocation check of server certificates, either with AIA or
CRL-DP. The new option `--skip-revocation-check` allows to skip the
check in situation where the OCSP server or the CRLs cannot be
accessed.

Alternatively, the generated error can be ignored using the option
`--ignore-cert-status` and the reported status error.
