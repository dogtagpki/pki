== <subsystem>-add-user now accepts attributes as an option ==

The `<subsystem>-add-user` methods accept a new option `--attributes` which takes a comma separated string of single-valued attributes as an argument, for example:

`pki-server <subsystem>-add-user <instance> <other options> --attributes "ham:spam,foo:bar"`

== Renaming pki-certsrv.jar to pki-common.jar ==

Previously the `pki-certsrv.jar` was installed under `WEB-INF/lib` folder of each web application.
The file has been moved into the `common/lib` folder and renamed into `pki-common.jar` such that it is available for the entire server.
