= Tools Changes =

== Drop sslget ==

The `sslget` command has been moved from `pki-tools` into `jss-tools`.

== Update pki-server status ==

The `pki-server status` command has been updated to no longer show
the subsystem `Type` field since it's redundant.

Instead, it will show an `SD Manager` field which will indicate whether
the subsystem is a security domain manager.
