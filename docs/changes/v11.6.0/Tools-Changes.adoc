= Tools Changes =

== Move PKI tools into jss-tools ==

The following tools have been moved into `jss-tools`:

* `p12tool`
* `sslget`

== Update pki-server status ==

The `pki-server status` command has been updated to no longer show
the subsystem `Type` field since it's redundant.

Instead, it will show an `SD Manager` field which will indicate whether
the subsystem is a security domain manager.
