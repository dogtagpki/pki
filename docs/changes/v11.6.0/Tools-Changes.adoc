= Tools Changes =

== Move PKI tools into jss-tools ==

The following tools have been moved into `jss-tools`:

* `p12tool`
* `p7tool`
* `sslget`

== Update pki-server status ==

The `pki-server status` command has been updated to no longer show
the subsystem `Type` field since it's redundant.

Instead, it will show an `SD Manager` field which will indicate whether
the subsystem is a security domain manager.

== Update certifcate enrollment commands ==

The `pki ca-cert-request-submit` command has been updated to provide options
to specify the enrollment password and PIN.

== Update certifcate revocation commands ==

The `pki ca-cert-revoke`, `pki ca-cert-hold`, and `pki ca-cert-release-hold` commands
have been updated to accept multiple serial numbers.

== Deprecate revoker tool ==

The `revoker` tool has been deprecated. Use the following commands instead:

* `pki ca-cert-revoke`
* `pki ca-cert-hold`
* `pki ca-cert-release-hold`
