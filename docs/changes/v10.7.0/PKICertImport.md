`PKICertImport`
===============

In v10.7.0, `PKICertImport` has enhanced functionality, including support for
`.p12` / PKCS12 certificate chains with keys. This utility is most useful in a
Common Criteria environment, where certificates must be validated before they
can be imported.

For more information, see the `PKICertImport` man page or the associated
design documents.
