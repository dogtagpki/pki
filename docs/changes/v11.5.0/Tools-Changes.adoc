== New pki-server cert-validate CLI ==

The `pki-server cert-validate` command has been added to validate a system certificate.

== New SAN option for pki nss-cert CLIs ==

The `pki nss-cert-request` and `pki nss-cert-issue` commands have been
modified to provide a `--subjectAltName` option.
This option will override the `subjectAltName` parameter in the extension
configuration file.

== Deprecate sslget ==

The `sslget` command has been deprecated.
Use `pki` CLI or the `curl` command instead.
