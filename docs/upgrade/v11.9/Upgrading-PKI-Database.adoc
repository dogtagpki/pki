This page describes the process to upgrade an older PKI database into a PKI 11.9 database.

== Updating nsPagedSizeLimit ==

If the existing CA or KRA is configured to use Sequential Serial Numbers
and it's also configured to use an LDAP user (e.g. `pkidbuser`) to access
the database, update the `nsPagedSizeLimit` with the following command:

----
$ pki-server ca-user-mod \
    --attr nsPagedSizeLimit=-1 \
    pkidbuser
----

The change will be replicated automatically to other replicas.
