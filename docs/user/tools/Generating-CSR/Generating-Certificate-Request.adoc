== Overview ==

This page describe the process to generate certificate request.

Note that the link:../PKI-Client-CLI.adoc[PKI Client CLI] provides a simplified mechanism to generate and submit a CSR for client certificates. See link:../../../design/Cert_Enrollment_Profiles/Certificate-Profiles.adoc[Certificate Profiles].

== Generating PKCS #10 Request ==

If key archival is not needed, a PKCS #10 request can be generated with the following methods:

* link:Generating-Certificate-Request-with-PKI-NSS.adoc[Generating Certificate Request with PKI NSS]
* link:Generating-Certificate-Request-with-PKCS10Client.adoc[Generating Certificate Request with PKCS10Client]
* link:Generating-Certificate-Request-with-NSS.adoc[Generating Certificate Request with NSS]
* link:Generating-Certificate-Request-with-OpenSSL.adoc[Generating Certificate Request with OpenSSL]

== Generating CRMF Request ==

If key archival is needed, generate a CRMF request with KRA transport certificate (see link:../Getting-KRA-Transport-Certificate.adoc[Getting KRA Transport Certificate]):

* link:Generating-Certificate-Request-with-CRMFPopClient.adoc[Generating Certificate Request with CRMFPopClient]
