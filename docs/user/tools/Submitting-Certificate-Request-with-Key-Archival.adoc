= Submitting Certificate Request with Key Archival =

== Overview ==

This page describes the process to generate a certificate request and submit it with key archival.

There are several ways to generate and submit the request:

* using `CRMFPopClient`
* using `pki client-cert-request`

The following certificate profiles support key archival:

* `caECUserCert`
* `caDualCert`
* `caSigningUserCert`

== Submitting Certificate Request with CRMFPopClient ==

First, obtain KRA transport certificate (see link:Getting-KRA-Transport-Certificate.adoc[Getting KRA Transport Certificate]).

Then submit the certificate request with the following command: 

----
$ CRMFPopClient \
    -d ~/.dogtag/nssdb \
    -p "" \
    -m pki.example.com:8080 \
    -f caDualCert \
    -n UID=testuser \
    -u testuser \
    -b kra_transport.crt
Submitting CRMF request to pki.example.com:8080
Request ID: 10
Request Status: pending
Reason:
----

== Submitting Certificate Request with PKI CLI ==

Submit a certificate request with the following command: 

----
$ pki client-cert-request UID=testuser \
    --profile caDualCert \
    --type crmf
-----------------------------
Submitted certificate request
-----------------------------
  Request ID: 10
  Type: enrollment
  Request Status: pending
  Operation Result: success
----

By default it will download the transport certificate from the CA. To use a transport certificate stored in a local file, specify `--transport <filename>`. Either way, the transport certificate will be imported into the clientâ€™s NSS database.
