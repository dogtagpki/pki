== Overview ==

PKI CLI is a client tool that can be used to access various services on PKI server.

== Installation ==

When installing PKI server the PKI CLI (and the PKI Client library) will automatically be installed.

To install PKI CLI on a machine that does not have PKI server, execute the following command:

----

----

== Usage ==

In general the PKI CLI takes the following parameters:

----
$ pki [CLI options] <command> [command arguments/options]
----

The CLI options should be placed before the command. The command arguments/options should be placed after the command.

To view available commands and options:

Some commands may have sub-commands. To view the sub-commands:

----
$ pki <command>
----
