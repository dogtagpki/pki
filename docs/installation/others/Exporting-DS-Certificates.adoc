= Exporting DS Certificates =

== Overview ==

This page describes the process to export the signing certificate and the server certificate from the NSS database of a DS instance.

By default the certificates are generated automatically during installation,
but they can also be created after installation.

This page assumes that a DS instance named `localhost` is already created and has the certificates.

== Exporting DS Signing Certificate ==

To export DS signing certificate:

----
$ certutil -L -d /etc/dirsrv/slapd-localhost -n Self-Signed-CA -a > ds_signing.crt
----

== Exporting DS Server Certificate ==

To export DS server certificate:

----
$ certutil -L -d /etc/dirsrv/slapd-localhost -n Server-Cert -a > ds_server.crt
----
