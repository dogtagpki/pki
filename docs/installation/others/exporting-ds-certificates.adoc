= Exporting DS Certificates 

Follow this process to export the bootstrap signing certificate and the server certificate from the NSS database of a DS instance.

By default the certificates are generated automatically during installation,
but they can also be created after installation.

This section assumes that a DS instance named `localhost` is already created and has the certificates.
