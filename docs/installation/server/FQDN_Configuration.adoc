= FQDN Configuration =

== Overview ==

In order to have a properly functioning PKI system,
each machine in the system must have a correct fully qualified domain name.

This page describes the process to verify and configure
the fully qualified domain name on each machine.

== Verifying FQDN ==

To verify the current FQDN, execute the following command:

----
$ python -c 'import socket; print(socket.getfqdn())'
server.example.com
----

== Configuring FQDN ==

To configure the FQDN, specify the FQDN in `/etc/hosts`, for example:

----
127.0.0.1 server.example.com
::1 server.example.com
----
