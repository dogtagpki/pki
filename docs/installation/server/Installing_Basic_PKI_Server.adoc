= Installing Basic PKI Server

== Overview

This page describes the process to create and configure a basic PKI server without any of the PKI subsystems.
This would be useful to troubleshoot general server issues (e.g. SSL).

== Installation

To install PKI server packages:

```
$ dnf install pki-server
```

== Creating PKI Server

To create a PKI server:

```
$ pki-server create
```

This will create a PKI server in /var/lib/pki/pki-tomcat.
