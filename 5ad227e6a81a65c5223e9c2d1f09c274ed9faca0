I suggest you put the following methods in CryptoUtil.java so that their usage is not limited to kra, and can also be used by clients.\nAlso, for encryption ones, the \"private_key\" don\u0027t necessarily have to be private key, so renaming them as though they are for encrypting and decrypting some data would be useful for other applications as well.",
