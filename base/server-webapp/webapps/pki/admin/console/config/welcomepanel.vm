A Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system creates, manages, and revokes keys and certificates.
<p>
Dogtag Certificate System (DCS) $productversion
 is a robust PKI system consisting of numerous subsystems including a Certificate Authority (CA), a Registration Authority (RA), a Data Recovery Manager (DRM), an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Manager, a Token Key Service (TKS), and a Token Processing System (TPS), as well as a multi-platform smartcard middleware software client called Enterprise Security Client (ESC).
<p>
For any subsystem to be useable, a user must use this wizard to configure an instance of this subsystem.
#if ($systemType != "tps")
<p>
Additionally, this wizard may also be used to clone any existing instance to achieve scalability and high-availability.
