    In order for ESC to submit certificate requests to TPS, the end user's identity must first be verified.  To accomplish this, an end user first sends a uid and password to TPS.  TPS must then contact an LDAP server (e.g. - a corporate LDAP directory server) to verify this end user's identity.
<p>
If the end user's identity is successfully verified, TPS will establish an authenticated connection with this ESC, and begin accepting certificate requests and issuing certificates to this end user.
<p>
If, however, the end user's identity fails to be verified, TPS will not establish a connection with this ESC. TPS never issues certificates to unauthenticated end users.
