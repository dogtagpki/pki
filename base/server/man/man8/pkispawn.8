.SH NAME
pkispawn \- Sets up an instance of Certificate Server.

.SH SYNOPSIS
pkispawn \-s <subsystem> \-f <config_file> [\-h] [\-v] [\-p <prefix>]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Sets up an instance of Certificate Server.  This utility creates any of the Java-based Certificate Server subsystems (CA, KRA, OCSP, and TKS). 
.TP
\fBNote:\fP 
A 389 Directory Server instance must be configured and running before this script can be run. Certificate Server requires an internal directory database. The default configuration assumes a Directory Server instance running on the same machine on port 389.  For more information on creating a Directory Server instance, see
.B setup-ds.pl(8).
.PP
An instance can contain multiple subsystems, although it may contain at most one of each type of subsystem on a single machine.  So, for example, an instance could contain CA and KRA subsystems,  but not two CA subsystems.  To create an instance with a CA and a KRA, simply run pkispawn twice, with values 
.I -s CA 
and 
.I -s KRA 
respectively.
.PP
The instances are created based on values for configuration parameters in the default configuration (/etc/pki/default.cfg) and the user-provided configuration file.  The user-provided configuration file is read after the default configuration file, so any parameters defined in that file will override parameters in the default configuration file.  In general, most users will store only those parameters which are different from the default configuration in their user-provided configuration file.
.PP
This configuration file contains directives that are divided into sections for different subsystem types (such as [DEFAULT], [CA], and [KRA]).  These sections are stacked, so that parameters read in earlier sections can be overwritten by parameters in later sections.  For the Java subsystems (CA, KRA, OCSP and TKS), the sections read are [DEFAULT], [Tomcat] and the subsystem-type section ([CA], [KRA], [OCSP], or [TKS]), in that order.  This allows the ability to specify parameters to be shared by all subsystems in [DEFAULT] or [Tomcat], and system-specific upgrades in the [CA], [KRA], and other sections.
.TP
\fBNote:\fP
Any non-password related parameter values in the configuration file that needs to contain a \fB%\fP character must be properly escaped.  For example, a value of \fBfoo%bar\fP would be specified as \fBfoo%%bar\fP in the configuration file.
.PP
At a minimum, the user-defined configuration file must provide some passwords needed for the install.  An example configuration file is provided in the 
.B EXAMPLES
section below.  For more information on the default configuration file and the parameters it contains (and can be customized), see
.B pki_default.cfg(5).
.PP
The \fBpkispawn\fP run creates several different installation files that can be referenced later, if need be:
.IP
* For Tomcat-based instances, a Tomcat instance is created at \fT/var/lib/pki/<pki_instance_name>\fP, where pki_instance_name is defined in the configuration file.  
.IP
* A log file of \fBpkispawn\fP operations is written to \fI/var/log/pki/pki-<subsystem>-spawn.<timestamp>.log\fP.  
.IP
* A .p12 (PKCS #12) file containing a certificate for a subsystem administrator is stored in pki_client_dir. 
.PP
When the utility is done running, the CA can be accessed by pointing a browser to https://<hostname>:<pki_https_port>/. The agent pages can be accessed by importing the CA certificate and administrator certificate into the browser. 
.PP
The Certificate Server instance can also be accessed using the \fBpki\fP command line interface.  See 
\fBpki(1)\fP. For more extensive documentation on how to use Certificate Server features, see the Red Hat Certificate System Documentation at https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/Red_Hat_Certificate_System/.
.PP
Instances created using \fBpkispawn\fP can be removed using \fBpkidestroy\fP.  See
.BR pkidestroy(8).
.PP
\fBpkispawn\fP supersedes and combines the functionality of \fBpkicreate\fP and \fBpkisilent\fP, which were available in earlier releases of Certificate Server.  It is now possible to completely create and configure the Certificate Server subsystem in a single step using \fBpkispawn\fP.
.TP
\fBNote:\fP 
Previously, as an alternative to using \fBpkisilent\fP to perform a non-interactive batch configuration, a PKI instance could be interactively configured by a GUI-based configuration wizard via a Firefox browser.  GUI-based configuration of a PKI instance is unavailable in this version of the product.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -s <subsystem>
Specifies the subsystem to be installed and configured, where <subsystem> is CA, KRA, OCSP, or TKS.
.TP
.B -f <config_file>
Specifies the path to the user-defined configuration file.  This file contains differences between the default configuration and the custom configuration.
.TP
.B -h, --help
Prints additional help information.
.TP
.B -v
Displays verbose information about the installation.  This flag can be provided multiple times to increase verbosity.  See
.B pkispawn -h 
for details.

.SH INTERACTIVE MODE
.PP
If no options are specified, pkispawn will provide an interactive menu to collect the parameters needed to install
the Certificate Server instance.  Note that only the most basic installation options are provided.  This includes root CAs,
KRAs, OCSPs and TKS, connecting to the LDAP port of a directory server.  More complicated setups such as: cloned subsystems, subordinate or externally signed CAs, subsystems that connect to the directory server using LDAPS, and subsystems that are customized beyond the options described below -  require the use of a configuration file with the
\-f option.
.PP
The interactive option is most useful for those users getting familiar with Certificate Server.  The parameters collected are
written to the installation file of the subsystem, which can be found at \fB/etc/sysconfig/pki/tomcat/<instance name>/<subsystem>/deployment.cfg.\fP
.PP
The following parameters are queried interactively during the installation process:
.PP
\fBSubsystem Type\fP
.TP
\fISubsystem (CA/KRA/OCSP/TKS):\fP
the type of subsystem to be installed. Prompted when the \-s option is not specified.  The default value chosen is CA.
.PP
\fBInstance Specific Parameters\fP
.TP
\fIInstance name:\fP
the name of the tomcat instance in which the subsystem is to be installed. The default value is pki-tomcat.
.br
\fBNote:\fP Only one subsystem of a given type (CA, KRA, OCSP, TKS) can exist within a given instance.
.TP
\fIHTTP port:\fP
the HTTP port of the Tomcat instance. The default value is 8080.

the AJP port of the Tomcat instance. The default value is 8009.
.TP
\fIManagement port:\fP
the management port of the Tomcat instance. The default value is 8005.
.TP
\fBNote:\fP When deploying a new subsystem into an existing instance, pkispawn will attempt to read the ports from \fBdeployment.cfg\fP files stored for previously installed subsystems for this instance.  If successful, the installer will not prompt for these ports. 
.PP
\fBAdministrative User Parameters\fP
.TP
\fIUsername:\fP
the username of the administrator of this subsystem. The default value is <ca/kra/tks/ocsp>admin.

.TP
\fIDirectory Server CA certificate pem file:\fP
The fully-qualified path including the filename of the file which contains an exported copy of the Directory Server's CA certificate (e. g. - /root/dscacert.pem).  This file must exist prior to \fBpkispawn\fP being able to utilize it.  For details on creation of this file see the
.B EXAMPLES
section below entitled
.B Installing a CA connecting securely to a Directory Server via LDAPS.
.
.TP
\fILDAP Port:\fP
LDAP port for the directory server instance. The default value is 389.
.TP
\fIBase DN:\fP

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS CA using default configuration
\x'-1'\fBpkispawn \-s CA \-f myconfig.txt\fR
.PP
where \fImyconfig.txt\fP contains the following text:
.IP
.nf
[DEFAULT]
pki_admin_password=\fIpassword123\fP
pki_client_pkcs12_password=\fIpassword123\fP
pki_ds_password=\fIpassword123\fP
.fi
.PP
Prior to running this command, a Directory Server instance should be created and running. This command assumes that the Directory Server instance is using its default configuration:
.IP
* Installed on the local machine
.IP
* Listening on port 389 
.IP
* The user is cn=Directory Manager, with the password specified in pki_ds_password

This invocation of \fBpkispawn\fP creates a Tomcat instance containing a CA running on the local machine with secure port 8443 and unsecure port 8080.  To access this CA, simply point a browser to https://<hostname>:8443.
.PP
The instance name (defined by pki_instance_name) is pki-tomcat, and it is located at \fI/var/lib/pki/pki-tomcat\fP.  Logs for the instance are located at \fI/var/log/pki/pki-tomcat\fP, and an installation log is written to \fI/var/log/pki/pki-<subsystem>-spawn.<timestamp>.log\fP.
.PP
A PKCS #12 file containing the administrator certificate is created in \fI$HOME/.dogtag/pki-tomcat\fP.  This PKCS #12 file uses the password designated by pki_client_pkcs12_password in the configuration file.
.PP
To access the agent pages, first import the CA certificate by accessing the CA End Entity Pages and clicking on the Retrieval Tab.  Be sure to trust the CA certificate.  Then, import the administrator certificate in the PKCS #12 file.
.SS CA using ECC default configuration

pki_ocsp_signing_key_size=nistp256
pki_ocsp_signing_key_type=ecc
pki_ocsp_signing_signing_algorithm=SHA256withEC
.fi
.PP
In order to utilize ECC, the SSL Server and Subsystem key algorithm, key size, and key type should be changed from SHA256withRSA --> SHA256withEC, 2048 --> nistp256, and rsa --> ecc, respectively.
.PP
Additionally, for a CA subsystem, both the CA and OCSP Signing key algorithm, key size, key type, and signing algorithm should be changed from SHA256withRSA --> SHA256withEC, 2048 --> nistp256, rsa --> ecc, and SHA256withRSA --> SHA256withEC,respectively.
.TP
\fBNote:\fP
For all PKI subsystems including the CA, ECC is not supported for the corresponding Audit Signing parameters.  Similarly, for KRA subsystems, ECC is not supported for either of the corresponding Storage or Transport parameters.
.SS KRA, OCSP, or TKS using default configuration
\x'-1'\fBpkispawn \-s <subsystem> \-f myconfig.txt\fR
.PP
where subsystem is KRA, OCSP, or TKS, and \fImyconfig.txt\fP contains the following text: 
.IP
.nf
[DEFAULT]
pki_admin_password=\fIpassword123\fP
pki_client_database_password=\fIpassword123\fP
pki_client_pkcs12_password=\fIpassword123\fP
pki_ds_password=\fIpassword123\fP
pki_security_domain_password=\fIpassword123\fP
.fi
.PP
The \fBpki_security_domain_password\fP is the admin password of the CA installed in the same default instance. This command should be run after a CA is installed.  This installs another subsystem within the same default instance using the certificate generated for the CA administrator for the subsystem's administrator.  This allows a user to access both subsystems on the browser with a single administrator certificate.  To access the new subsystem's functionality, simply point the browser to https://<hostname>:8443 and click the relevant top-level links.
.SS KRA, OCSP, or TKS connecting to a remote CA
\x'-1'\fBpkispawn \-s <subsystem> \-f myconfig.txt\fR
.PP
where subsystem is KRA, OCSP, or TKS, and \fImyconfig.txt\fP contains the following text:

pki_security_domain_user=caadmin
pki_issuing_ca_uri=https://<ca_hostname>:<ca_port>

[KRA]
pki_import_admin_cert=False
.fi
.PP
A remote CA is one where the CA resides in another Certificate Server instance, either on the local machine or a remote machine.  In this case, \fImyconfig.txt\fP must specify the connection information for the remote CA and the information about the security domain (the trusted collection of subsystems within an instance).
.PP
The subsystem section is [KRA], [OCSP], or [TKS].  This example assumes that the specified CA hosts the security domain.  The CA must be running and accessible.  
.PP 
A new administrator certificate is generated for the new subsystem and stored in a PKCS #12 file in \fI$HOME/.dogtag/pki-tomcat\fP.
.SS Installing a CA clone
\x'-1'\fBpkispawn \-s CA \-f myconfig.txt\fR

pki_clone_uri=https://<master_ca_hostname>:<master_ca_https_port>
.fi
.PP
A cloned CA is a CA which uses the same signing, OCSP signing, and audit signing certificates as the master CA, but issues certificates within a different serial number range.  It has its own internal database -- separate from the master CA database -- but using the same base DN, that keeps in sync with the master CA through replication agreements between the databases.  This is very useful for load sharing and disaster recovery. To create a clone, the \fImyconfig.txt\fP uses pki_clone-* parameters in its [CA] section which identify the original CA to use as a master template. Additionally, it connects to the master CA as a remote CA and uses its security domain.
.PP
Before the clone can be generated, the Directory Server must be created that is separate from the master CA's Directory Server.  The example assumes that the master CA and cloned CA are on different machines, and that their Directory Servers are on port 389.  In addition, the master's system certs and keys have been stored in a PKCS #12 file that is copied over to the clone subsystem in the location specified in <path_to_pkcs12_file>.  This file is created when the master CA is installed; it can also be generated using \fBPKCS12Export\fP.  The file needs to be readable by the user the Certificate Server runs as (by default, pkiuser) and be given the SELinux context pki_tomcat_cert_t.
.PP
.SS Installing a KRA or TKS clone (OCSP unsupported as of now)
\x'-1'\fBpkispawn \-s <subsystem> \-f myconfig.txt\fR

pki_clone_uri=https://<master_kra_host>:<master_kra_https_port>
pki_issuing_ca=https://<ca_hostname>:<ca_https_port>
.fi
.PP
As with a CA clone, a KRA or TKS clone uses the same certificates and basic configuration as the original subsystem. The configuration points to the original subsystem to copy its configuration. This example also assumes that the CA is on a remote machine and specifies the CA and security domain information.
.PP
The subsystem section is [KRA] or [TKS].
.SS Installing a subordinate CA
\x'-1'\fBpkispawn \-s CA \-f myconfig.txt\fR

pki_ca_signing_subject_dn=cn=CA Subordinate Signing,o=example.com
.fi
.PP
A sub-CA derives its certificate configuration -- such as allowed extensions and validity periods -- from a superior or root CA. Otherwise, the configuration of the CA is independent of the root CA, so it is its own instance rather than a clone. A sub-CA is configured using the pki_subordinate parameter and a pointer to the CA which issues the sub-CA's certificates.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP The value of \fBpki_ca_signing_subject_dn\fP of a subordinate CA should be different from the root CA's signing subject DN.
.SS Installing a subordinate CA which hosts its own security domain

In this section, the subordinate CA logs onto and registers with the security domain CA (using parameters \fBpki_security_domain_hostname\fP, \fBpki_security_domain_https_port\fP, \fBpki_security_domain_user\fP and \fBpki_security_domain_password\fP) as in the previous section, but also creates and hosts a new security domain.  To do this, \fBpki_subordinate_create_new_security_domain\fP must be set to \fBTrue\fP.  The subordinate CA security domain name can also be specified by specifying a value for \fBpki_subordinate_security_domain_name\fP.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP The value of \fBpki_ca_signing_subject_dn\fP of a subordinate CA should be different from the root CA's signing subject DN.
.SS Installing an externally signed CA
\x'-1'\fBpkispawn \-s CA \-f myconfig.txt\fR
.PP
This is a two step process.
.PP
In the first step, a certificate signing request (CSR) is generated for the signing certificate and \fImyconfig.txt\fP contains the following text:

pki_external=True
pki_external_csr_path=/tmp/ca_signing.csr
pki_ca_signing_subject_dn=cn=CA Signing,ou=External,o=example.com
.fi
.PP
The CSR is written to pki_external_csr_path.  The pki_ca_signing_subject_dn should be different from the subject DN of the external CA that is signing the request.  The pki_ca_signing_subject_dn parameter can be used to specify the signing certificate's subject DN.

.PP
The CSR is then submitted to the external CA, and the resulting certificate and certificate chain are saved to files on the system.

.PP
In the second step, the configuration file has been modified to install the issued certificates. In place of the original CSR, the configuration file now points to the issued CA certificate and certificate chain. There is also a flag to indicate that this completes the installation process (pki_external_step_two).

It should be noted that there are basically three scenarios in which a PKI subsystem (e. g. - a CA) needs to communicate securely via LDAPS with a directory server:
.IP
* A directory server exists which is already running LDAPS using a CA certificate that has been issued by some other CA.  For this scenario, the CA certificate must be made available via a PEM file during \fBpkispawn\fP installation/configuration such that the CA may be installed and configured to communicate with this directory server using LDAPS.
.IP
* A directory server exists which is currently running LDAP.  Once a CA has been created, there is a desire to use its CA certificate to issue an SSL certificate for this directory server so that this CA and this directory server can communicate via LDAPS.  For this scenario, since there is no need to communicate securely during the \fBpkispawn\fP installation/configuration, simply use \fBpkispawn\fP to install and configure the CA using the LDAP port of the directory server, issue an SSL certificate from this CA for the directory server, and then reconfigure the CA and directory server to communicate with each other via LDAPS.
.IP
* Similar to the previous scenario, a directory server exists which is currently running LDAP, and the desire is to create a CA and use it to establish LDAPS communications between this CA and this directory server.  However, for this scenario, there is a need for the CA and the directory server to communicate securely during \fBpkispawn\fP installation/configuration.  For this to succeed, the directory server must generate a temporary self-signed certificate for use during \fBpkispawn\fP installation/creation.  Once the CA has been created, swap things out to reconfigure the CA and directory server to utilize LDAPS through the desired certificates.  This example demonstrates the \fBpkispawn\fP portion of this particular scenario.
