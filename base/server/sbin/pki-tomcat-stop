# PKI Tomcat Shutdown Wrapper
#
# This script provides an abstraction layer for stopping Tomcat,
# detecting the installed Tomcat version and calling the appropriate
# shutdown command.

# Detect Tomcat flavor based on installed files

    # New Tomcat 10.1+ uses tomcat-run.sh
    # systemd will send SIGTERM to the process, no explicit stop needed
    exit 0
else
    # Old Tomcat10 uses 'server stop'
    exec /usr/libexec/tomcat/server stop
