# Setpin has a special setup mode which allows you to
# automate the following two tasks.
#
# * To enable setpin to operate, the directory schema must be
#   changed to add the pin attribute and pinPerson objectclass.
# 
# * To enable pin removal to work well, you can create a new
#   pin user with an ACI which lets the user remove the pin
#
