/**
 * This interface represents a CRL publisher that is
 * invoked when CRL publishing is requested by CMS.
 * Note that CMS, by default, shipped with a LDAP-based
 * CRL publisher that can be configured via
 * Certificiate Manager/LDAP Publishing panel. This
 * interface provides administrator additional capability
 * of publishing CRL to different destinations.
 *
 * The CRL publishing frequency is configured via
 * Netscape Certificate Server Console's
 * Certificate Manager/Revocation List panel.
 * The CRL publishing may occur either everytime a
 * certificate is revoked or at a pre-defined interval.
 *
 * To try out this new CRL publisher mechanism, do
 * the following:
 * (1) Write a sample CRL publisher class that implements
 * ICRLPublisher interface. For example,
 *
 * <code>
 * public class CRLPublisher implements ICRLPublisher
 * {
 * 	public void init(ISubsystem owner, IConfigStore config)
 * 		throws EBaseException
 * 	{
 * 		log(ILogger.LL_DEBUG, "CRLPublisher: Initialized");
 * 	}
 *
 * 	public void publish(String issuingPointId, X509CRLImpl crl)
 * 		throws EBaseException
 *      {
 * 		log(ILogger.LL_DEBUG, "CRLPublisher: " + issuingPointId +
 *                " crl=" + crl);
 * 	}
 *
 *      public void log(int level, String msg)
 *      {
 *              Logger.getLogger().log(ILogger.EV_SYSTEM,
 *                      null, ILogger.S_OTHER, level,
 *                      msg);
 *      }
 * }
 * </code>
 *
 * (2) Compile the class and place the class into
 * <server-root>\bin\cert\classes directory.
 * (3) Add the following parameter to CMS.cfg
 * ca.crlPublisher.class=<implementation class>
 * For example,
 * ca.crlPublisher.class=myCRLPublisher
 *
 * @version $Revision$, $Date$
