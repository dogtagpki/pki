 * UI Mapper Interface
 *
 * The UIMapper is intended for the editing and
 * the display of the certificate attributes. This
 * includes most the certificate attributes and extensions
 * defined in PKCS and PKIX.
 *
 * Each Individual UI Mapper should provide the methods
 * defined in this interface. It must extends the
 * JFC JPanel object. The UI Mapper should not exceeds
 * the size of 400(Width)x450(Height). Use of LayoutManager
 * is recommended.
 *
 * @author Jack Pan-Chen
 * @version $Revision$, $Date$
 * @see com.netscape.admin.certsrv
 * @deprecated The PKI console will be removed once there are CLI equivalents of desired console features.
