It\u0027s also always executed regardless of version number.\n\nThis script should actually be moved into system unit file too, but currently it does not accept instance name param, so that will need to be fixed first.\n\nSupposedly the NSS DBM to SQL migration could be implemented in this script too. Also, there will be a Tomcat 8.0 to 8.5 migration which will use this script too.",
