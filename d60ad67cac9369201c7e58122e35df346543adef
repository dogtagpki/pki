      "message": "The logic here looks right, but is a little hard to follow because its all in one method.\n\nIt would be better to refactor so that this method is much smaller.\n\nFor instance, you could easily extract a methods for - \n    setup_authentication() \n    extract_serial_number()\n    renew_system_certificate()\n\nThe name of this method (setup_perm_renewal) is a little misleading, because you are actually doing the renewal.\n\nNote that refactoring out extract_serial_number() will help you to solve the sslserver cert problem, because you could call that before switching out the subsystem cert for a temp cert, and pass it into this CLI call.  That way you are getting the serial number of the cert that is in the LDAP DB.",
